Informally, apoplexy is associated with being furious, especially as \"apoplectic. From the late 14th to the late 19th century, apoplexy referred to any sudden death that began with a sudden loss of consciousness, especially one in which the victim died within a matter of seconds after losing consciousness. The word apoplexy may have been used to refer to the symptom of sudden loss of consciousness immediately preceding death. Ruptured aortic aneurysms, and even heart attacks and strokes were referred to as apoplexy in the past, because before the advent of medical science there was little ability to differentiate pathoses because there was very little accurate understanding of physiology in general.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-02-25 05:04:15', 'Apoplexy', 'Apoplexy', 'Apoplexy', 'Apoplexy', 'Apoplexy'),
(3, 'Aplastic anemia', 'Aplastic anemia is a condition that occurs when your body stops producing enough new blood cells. Aplastic anemia leaves you feeling fatigued and with a higher risk of infections and uncontrolled bleeding. What Is Aplastic Anemia? Aplastic anemia (a-PLAS-tik uh-NEE-me-uh) is a blood disorder in which the body\'s bone marrow doesn\'t make enough new blood cells. Bone marrow is a sponge-like tissue inside the bones. It makes stem cells that develop into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (PLATE-lets). Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. They also carry carbon dioxide (a waste product) to your lungs to be exhaled. White blood cells help your body fight infections. Platelets are blood cell fragments that stick together to seal small cuts or breaks on blood vessel walls and stop bleeding. It\'s normal for blood cells to die. The lifespan of red blood cells is about 120 days. White blood cells live less than a day. Platelets live about 6 days. As a result, your bone marrow must constantly make new blood cells. If your bone marrow can\'t make enough new blood cells, many health problems can occur. These problems include irregular heartbeats called arrhythmias (ah-RITH-me-ahs), an enlarged heart, heart failure, infections, and bleeding. Severe aplastic anemia can even cause death. Aplastic anemia is a type of anemia. The term \"anemia\" usually refers to a condition in which your blood has a lower than normal number of red blood cells. Anemia also can occur if your red blood cells don\'t contain enough hemoglobin (HEE-muh-glow-bin). This iron-rich protein helps carry oxygen to your body. In people who have aplastic anemia, the body doesn\'t make enough red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This is because the bone marrow\'s stem cells are damaged. (Aplastic anemia also is called bone marrow failure.) Many diseases, conditions, and factors can damage the stem cells. These conditions can be acquired or inherited. \"Acquired\" means you aren\'t born with the condition, but you develop it. \"Inherited\" means your parents passed the gene for the condition on to you. In many people who have aplastic anemia, the cause is unknown.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-02-25 05:05:45', 'Aplastic anemia', 'Aplastic anemia', 'Aplastic anemia', 'Aplastic anemia', 'Aplastic anemia'),

They are very common and affect between 30-60% of the population.\n\n The cause of aphthae is still uncertain but hereditary factors are certainly significant with approximately 40% of people who get them having a family history of aphthae.\n\nThe main causes of aphthous ulcers include: emotional stress and lack of sleep, local injury by an accidental self-inflicted bite, nutritional/vitamin deficiencies (especially iron and folic acid, vitamins B1, B2, B6, B12 and vitamin C), the menstrual cycle and certain foods (including coffee and chocolate).

(6, 'Anorexia nervosa', 'Anorexia nervosa, often referred to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by a low weight, fear of gaining weight, a strong desire to be thin, and food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are underweight.If asked they usually deny they have a problem with low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others.Women will often stop having menstrual periods.\n\nIt\'s only human to wish you looked different or could fix something about yourself. But when a preoccupation with being thin takes over your eating habits, thoughts, and life, it\'s a sign of an eating disorder. When you have anorexia, the desire to lose weight becomes more important than anything else. You may even lose the ability to see yourself as you truly are.\n\nAnorexia is a serious eating disorder that affects women and men of all ages. It can damage your health and even threaten your life. But you\'re not alone. There\'s help available when you\'re ready to make a change. You deserve to be happy. Treatment will help you feel better and learn to value  \n\nAnorexia nervosa is a complex eating disorder with three key features:\n\nrefusal to maintain a healthy body weight\nan intense fear of gaining weight\na distorted body image\nBecause of your dread of becoming fat or disgusted with how your body looks, eating and mealtimes may be very stressful. And yet, what you can and can’t eat is practically all you can think about. Thoughts about dieting, food, and your body may take up most of your day—leaving little time for friends, family, and other activities you used to enjoy. Life becomes a relentless pursuit of thinness and going to extremes to lose weight.\n\nBut no matter how skinny you become, it’s never enough. While people with anorexia often deny having a problem, the truth is that anorexia is a serious and potentially deadly eating disorder. Fortunately, recovery is possible. With proper treatment and support, you or someone you care about can break anorexia’s self-destructive pattern and regain health and self-confidence.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'Anorexia nervosa', '', '', '', ''),
(7, 'Ankylosing spondylitis', 'Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that affects the spine. Ankylosing spondylitis symptoms include pain and stiffness from the neck down to the lower back. The spine\'s bones (vertebrae) may grow or fuse together, resulting in a rigid spine. These changes may be mild or severe, and may lead to a stooped-over posture. Early diagnosis and treatment helps control pain and stiffness and may reduce or prevent significant deformity.\n\n Who Is Affected by Ankylosing Spondylitis?\n\nAnkylosing spondylitis affects about 0.1% to 0.5% of the adult population. Although it can occur at any age, spondylitis most often strikes men in their teens and 20s. It is less common and generally milder in women and more common in some Native American tribes.\n\nWhat Are the Symptoms of Ankylosing Spondylitis?\n\nThe most common early symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis include:\n\nPain and stiffness. Constant pain and stiffness in the low back, buttocks, and hips that continue for more than three months. Spondylitis often starts around the sacroiliac joints, where the sacrum (the lowest major part of the spine) joins the ilium bone of the pelvis in the lower back region.\nBony fusion. Ankylosing spondylitis can cause an overgrowth of the bones, which may lead to abnormal joining of bones, called \"bony fusion.\" Fusion affecting bones of the neck, back, or hips may impair a person\'s ability to perform routine activities. Fusion of the ribs to the spine or breastbone may limit a person\'s ability to expand his or her chest when taking a deep breath.\nPain in ligaments and tendons. Spondylitis also may affect some of the ligaments and tendons that attach to bones. Tendonitis (inflammation of the tendon) may cause pain and stiffness in the area behind or beneath the heel, such as the Achilles tendon at the back of the ankle.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/7.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'Ankylosing spondylitis', '', '', '', ''),

A simple anal fistula includes low transsphincteric and intersphincteric fistulas that cross 30% of the external sphincter. Fistulas are complex if the primary track includes high transsphincteric fistulas with or without a high blind tract, suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric fistulas, horseshoe fistulas, multiple tracks, anteriorly lying track in a female patient, and those associated with inflammatory bowel disease, radiation, malignancy, preexisting incontinence, or chronic diarrhea.

Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year.Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, oratopic dermatitis.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/14.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'Allergic rhinitis', '', '', '', ''),
(13, 'Acidity ', 'Acidity refers to a set of symptoms caused by an imbalance between the acid secreting mechanism of the stomach and proximal intestine and the protective mechanisms that ensure their safety. The stomach normally secretes acid that is essential in the digestive process. This acid helps in breaking down the food during digestion. When there is excess production of acid by the gastric glands of the stomach, it results in the condition known as acidity.\n\n \n\nAn excess or imbalance of digestive acids produced by the stomach can cause a stomach ache, gas, nausea, bad breath and other symptoms. It is a common problem that affects people of all ages. Those who suffer frequently from acidity problems may refer to having an “acid stomach.” Eating spicy foods, lack of exercise, irregular eating habits, stress, or drinking alcohol frequently can lead to acidity problems. Some simple natural remedies can be used to treat stomach acidity. For instance, simply drinking a little water will help neutralize and flush out excess acid from your stomach. If you frequently suffer from acidity, drink a glass of lukewarm water every day before going to sleep and immediately after waking up in the morning. Do not drink water during or immediately after a meal though, as it can lead to improper digestion that can contribute to acidity.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/16.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'Acidity ', '', '', '', ''),
(14, 'Lower esophageal sphincter (LES)', 'At the entrance to your stomach is a valve, which is a ring of muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, the LES closes as soon as food passes through it.\n\n \n\nIf the LES doesn\'t close all the way or if it opens too often, acid produced by your stomach can move up into your esophagus. This can cause symptoms such as a burning chest paincalled heartburn. If acid reflux symptoms happen more than twice a week, you have acid reflux disease, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\n\nOne common cause of acid reflux disease is a stomach abnormality called a hiatal hernia. This occurs when the upper part of the stomach and LES move above the diaphragm, a muscle that separates your stomach from your chest. Normally, the diaphragm helps keep acid in our stomach. But if you have a hiatal hernia, acid can move up into your esophagus and cause symptoms of acid reflux disease.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/17.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'Lower esophageal sphincter (LES)', '', '', '', ''),
(15, 'Cause of abdominal problems', 'The cause of abdominal problems can be hard to pinpoint. Sometimes minor and serious abdominal problems start with the same symptoms. Fortunately, most abdominal problems are minor, and home treatment is all that is needed.\n\n Occasionally, severe pain that comes on suddenly may be a symptom of a rupture of the stomach or intestines (perforation), torsion of the testicle or ovary, a kidney stone, gallbladder disease, or blood vessel problems, such as an aortic aneurysm. The pain caused by appendicitis or gallbladder disease may increase when you move or cough. Pain that increases with movement or coughing and does not appear to be caused by strained muscles is more likely to be a symptom of a serious problem. A visit to a doctor is usually needed when severe abdominal pain comes on suddenly, or when new and different mild pain slowly becomes more severe over several hours or days.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'Cause of abdominal problems', '', '', '', ''),

Modern homoeopathy also  allows treatment of multiple diseases with same  medicines in same time along with rest of existing  treatment. Most important Modern Homoeopathy works specially on limitations of homoeopathy & provides new scope of hope for homoeopathy even in most complicated & incurable disorders.\n\nIn Modern homoeopathy for any and every kind of diseases there are curative and supportive  both types of approaches are possible, even it may take along with rest of any medical system as per stage and severity of diseases & requirement of individual patient.

Modern Homeopathy does not believe in traditional   law of homoeopathy that while taking homoeopathy medicines  there should be restriction of high smelling food, as due to high quality and potentised  medicines forms modern homoeopathy does not consider all these restriction at all that’s way modern homoeopathy provides very easy treatment in very less medicinal doses without any  restriction and heavy breakfast of medicines.\n\nSAFE: – In modern homoeopathy there is no sideeffects of medicines even after use of highly potentised medicinal selection as per requirement of response or stages of diseases. As we know while homoeopathy potentisation process  the power or potency or quality  of medicines will increase gradually  & simultaneously its quantity of medicinal substance will be reduced hence use of less crude form & the chance of side effects are almost nil, which should be  very important for any of the medical system and it is possible only in modern homoeopathy irrespective of any other health system.', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/19.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'MODERN HOMOEOPATHY ', '', '', '', ''),

There may also be enlargement of the forehead, jaw, and nose. Other symptoms may include joint pain, thicker skin, deepening of the voice, headaches, and problems with vision. Complications of the disease may include type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure.[3]\n\nAcromegaly is typically due to the pituitary gland producing too much growth hormone. In more than 95% of cases the excess production is due to a benign tumor, known as a pituitary adenoma. The condition is not inherited from a person\'s parents. Rarely acromegaly is due to tumors in other parts of the body. Diagnosis is by measuring growth hormone after a person has drunk glucose or by measuring insulin-like growth factor I in the blood. After diagnosis, medical imaging of the pituitary is carried out to look for an adenoma. If excess growth hormone is produced during childhood the result is gigantism.[3]\nDR ARPIT CHOPRA (MD HOMOEOPATHY)\nChief Consultant Homoeopath & Biochemic\nAAROGYA SUPERSPECIALITY MODERN HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC(Computerised) \nwebsite- www.homoeopathycure.com', 1, '', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'ACROMEGALY CURE BY  MODERN HOMOEOPATHY IN COMPLETE, PERMANENT  EASY, SAFE , FAST & COST EFFECTIVE PERMANENT MODE', '', '', '', ''),

Darkening of the skin in certain areas may also occur. Under certain circumstances, an adrenal crisis may occur with low blood pressure, vomiting, lower back pain, and loss of consciousness. An adrenal crisis can be triggered by stress, such as from an injury, surgery, or infection.[1]\n\nAddison\'s disease arises from problems with the adrenal gland such that not enough of the steroid hormone cortisol and possibly aldosterone are produced, [1] most often due to damage by the body\'s own immune system in the developed world and tuberculosis in the developing world.[4] Other causes include certain medications, sepsis, and bleeding into both adrenal glands.[1][4] Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by not enough adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (produced by the pituitary gland) or CRH (produced by the hypothalamus). Despite this distinction, adrenal crises can happen in all forms of adrenal insufficiency.

Symptom onset is often within minutes following exposure and they can affect sleep, the ability to work, and the ability to concentrate at school.[3] Those whose symptoms are due to pollen typically develop symptoms during specific times of the year.[4] Many people with allergic rhinitis also have asthma, allergic conjunctivitis, or atopic dermatitis.[3]\n\nAllergic rhinitis is typically triggered by environmental allergens such as pollen, pet hair, dust, or mold. Inherited genetics and environmental exposures contribute to the development of allergies.[4] Growing up on a farm and having multiple siblings decreases the risk. The underlying mechanism involves IgE antibodies attaching to the allergen and causing the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells.[3] Diagnosis is usually based on a medical history in combination with a skin prick test or blood tests for allergen-specific IgE antibodies.

Dementia is the loss of cognitive functioning—thinking, remembering, and reasoning—and behavioral abilities to such an extent that it interferes with a person’s daily life and activities.

Anemia that comes on quickly often has greater symptoms, which may include confusion, feeling like one is going to pass out, loss of consciousness, or increased thirst. Anemia must be significant before a person becomes noticeably pale. Additional symptoms may occur depending on the underlying cause.[1]\n\nThe three main types of anemia are due to blood loss, decreased red blood cell production, and increased red blood cell breakdown. Causes of blood loss include trauma and gastrointestinal bleeding, among others. Causes of decreased production include iron deficiency, a lack of vitamin B12, thalassemia, and a number of neoplasms of the bone marrow. Causes of increased breakdown include a number of genetic conditions such as sickle cell anemia, infections like malaria, and certain autoimmune diseases. It can also be classified based on the size of red blood cells and amount of hemoglobin in each cell. If the cells are small, it is microcytic anemia. If they are large, it is macrocytic anemia while if they are normal sized, it is normocytic anemia.[1] Diagnosis in men is based on a hemoglobin of less than 130 to 140 g/L (13 to 14 g/dL), while in women, it must be less than 120 to 130 g/L (12 to 13 g/dL).[1][6] Further testing is then required to determine the cause.\nDR ARPIT CHOPRA (MD HOMOEOPATHY)\nChief Consultant Homoeopath & Biochemic\nAAROGYA SUPERSPECIALITY MODERN HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC(Computerised)\nwebsite- www.homoeopathycure.com', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/91.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'ANAEMIA CURED BY - EASY, SAFE, FAST & COST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT', '', '', '', ''),

Curly hair tends to curl into the skin instead of straight out the follicle, leading to an inflammation reaction. PFB can make the skin look itchy and red, and in some cases, it can even look like pimples. These inflamed papules or pustules can form especially if the area becomes infected.\n\nThis is especially problematic for some men who have naturally coarse or tightly curling thick hair. Curly hair increases the likelihood of PFB by a factor of 50.[4] If left untreated over time, this can cause keloid scarring in the beard area.\n\nPseudofolliculitis barbae can further be divided into two types of ingrown hairs: transfollicular and extrafollicular. The extrafollicular hair is a hair that has exited the follicle and reentered the skin. The transfollicular hair never exits the follicle, but because of its naturally curly nature curls back into the follicle causing fluid build-up and irritation.\n\nKeratin polymorphism[edit]\nA common polymorphism in a keratin gene (K6hf) has been linked to PFB, suggesting that it may be a genetic risk factor.[5] This sequence change leads to an amino acid substitution in the highly conserved helix initiation motif of the K6hf rod domain.[4] Carriers of the A12T polymorphism are six times more likely to develop PFB compared with people homozygous for the wild-type K6hf sequence.[5] This suggests K6hf mutation structurally weakens the companion layer separating the inner and outer root sheath and increases the chances that a beard hair will in-grow.[5]\nDR ARPIT CHOPRA (MD HOMOEOPATHY)\nChief Consultant Homoeopath & Biochemic\nAAROGYA SUPERSPECIALITY MODERN HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC(Computerised)\n102, First Floor, Krishna Tower, Opposite Curewell\nHospital, Newpalasia, Indore (M.P.)\nMob 9713092737 /  9713037737/ 9907527914(whats up no)\nPH - 0731-2532737, 3961737\nwebsite- www.homoeopathycure.com', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/113.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', '2023-01-30 12:20:00', 'BARBERS ITCH CURE BY EASY, SAFE, FAST & COST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT', '', '', '', ''),

This is commonly referred to as \"obstruction\", although the urethral lumen is no less patent, only compressed. Resistance to urine flow requires the bladder to work harder during voiding, possibly leading to progressive hypertrophy, instability, or weakness (atony) of the bladder muscle.

These secretions increase the amount of bacteria in the lungs, result in airway blockage and further breakdown of the airways.[2] It is classified as an obstructive lung disease, along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.[11] The diagnosis is suspected based on a person\'s symptoms and confirmed using computed tomography.[6] Cultures of the mucus produced may be useful to determine treatment in those who have acute worsening and at least once a year.[6]\n\nDR ARPIT CHOPRA (MD HOMOEOPATHY)\nChief Consultant Homoeopath & Biochemic\nAAROGYA SUPERSPECIALITY MODERN HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC(Computerised)\n102, First Floor, Krishna Tower, Opposite Curewell\nHospital, Newpalasia, Indore (M.P.)\nwebsite- www.homoeopathycure.com', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/122.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', ' BRONCHIECTASIS CURE BY EASY, SAFE, FAST & COST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT', '', '', '', ''),

For ‘normal’ body temperatures – benign temperatures near the species\' mean – thermal biology traditionally uses performance curves to describe how physiological capabilities vary with temperature. However, these curves, which are typically measured under static laboratory conditions, can yield incomplete or inaccurate predictions of how organisms respond to natural patterns of temperature variation. For example, scale transition theory predicts that, in a variable environment, peak average performance is lower and occurs at a lower mean temperature than the peak of statically measured performance. We also demonstrate that temporal variation in performance is minimized near this new ‘optimal’ temperature. These factors add complexity to predictions of the consequences of climate change. We then move beyond the performance curve approach to consider the effects of rare, extreme temperatures. A statistical procedure (the environmental bootstrap) allows for long-term simulations that capture the temporal pattern of extremes (a Poisson interval distribution), which is characterized by clusters of events interspersed with long intervals of benign conditions. The bootstrap can be combined with biophysical models to incorporate temporal, spatial and physiological variation into evolutionary models of thermal tolerance. We conclude with several challenges that must be overcome to more fully develop our understanding of thermal performance in the context of a changing climate by explicitly considering different forms of small-scale variation. These challenges highlight the need to empirically and rigorously test existing theories.\nDR ARPIT CHOPRA (MD HOMOEOPATHY)\nChief Consultant Homoeopath & Biochemic\nAAROGYA SUPERSPECIALITY MODERN HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC(Computerised)\n102, First Floor, Krishna Tower, Opposite Curewell\nHospital, Newpalasia, Indore (M.P.)\nMob 9713092737 /  9713037737/ 9907527914(whats up no)\nPH - 0731-2532737, 3961737\nwebsite- www.homoeopathycure.com', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/153.jpg', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', 'THERMAL VARIATIONS CURE BY  MODERN HOMEOPATHY PERMANENT, SAFE & COST EFFECTIVE', '', '', '', ''),

Occasionally an infant will be born with one or more teeth already protruding from the gums, but this is no cause for alarm.\nThough the order in which teeth appear during teething differs from person to person, it tends to follow a general pattern. The first teeth to appear are nearly always the central incisors, (those two teeth in the center of the mouth on the bottom). The top central and lateral incisors appear next, (the four central top teeth). Next come the bottom lateral incisors, (the two teeth on either side of the bottom central incisors). Then the basic molars (in the back of the jaw). And lastly, the eye teeth, (the pointed teeth on the top). Most infants have twenty baby teeth in all.\n\nThe symptoms of teething are now known to be extremely mild.

There are three major types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, andgestational diabetes.\n\nAll types of diabetes mellitus have something in common. Normally, your body breaks down the sugars and carbohydrates you eat into a special sugar called glucose. Glucose fuels the cells in your body. But the cells need insulin, a hormone, in your bloodstream in order to take in the glucose and use it for energy. With diabetes mellitus, either your body doesn’t make enough insulin, it can’t use the insulin it does produce, or a combination of both.\n\nSince the cells can’t take in the glucose, it builds up in your blood. High levels of blood glucose can damage the tiny blood vessels in yourkidneys, heart, eyes, or nervous system. That’s why diabetes — especially if left untreated — can eventually cause heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and nerve damage to nerves in the feet. Type 1 diabetes is also called insulin-dependent diabetes. It used to be called juvenile-onset diabetes, because it often begins in childhood. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition.

The inner ear makes the nerve impulses that are sent to the brain. Your brain recognizes them as sounds.

The eardrum can also be perforated by a sudden change in pressure—either an increase, such as that caused by an explosion, a slap, or diving underwater; or a decrease, such as occurs while flying in an airplane. Another cause is burns from heat or chemicals. The eardrum may also be perforated (punctured) by objects placed in the ear, such as a cotton-tipped swab, or by objects entering the ear accidentally, such as a low-hanging twig or a thrown pencil. An object that penetrates the eardrum can dislocate or fracture the chain of small bones (ossicles) that connect the eardrum to the inner ear.

Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes.A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia.\n Several causes are known, with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitic infection. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (CBC), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia. The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside of the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia, which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line. Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though in idiopathiceosinophilia, the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids.Eosinophilia is not a disorder (rather, only a sign) unless it is idiopathic.\n\nEosinophilia can be idiopathic (primary) or, more commonly, secondary to another disease.

The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, and substance use disorders. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to only a small proportion of cases.[5][6] Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal cortical nerve cell activity in the brain.The diagnosis typically involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting.\n\nAdditionally, making the diagnosis involves determining if any other cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests.[5] Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered.

There are two types: anterior (the most common), and posterior (less common, more likely to require medical attention). Sometimes in more severe cases, the blood can come up the nasolacrimal duct and out from the eye. Fresh blood and clotted blood can also flow down into the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting.\nAlthough the sight of large amounts of blood can be alarming and may warrant medical attention, nosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the U.S. in 1999. The causes of nosebleeds can generally be divided into two categories, local and systemic factors, although a significant number of nosebleeds occur with no obvious cause.\n\nEpistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, is a common complaint. It is rarely life threatening but may cause significant concern, especially among parents of small children. Most nosebleeds are benign, self-limiting, and spontaneous, but some can be recurrent.

A penile erection is the hydraulic effect of blood entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis. The process is most often initiated as a result of sexual arousal, when signals are transmitted from the brain to nerves in the penis. The most important organic causes of impotence are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, neurological problems (for example, trauma from prostatectomy surgery), hormonal insufficiencies (hypogonadism) and drug side effects.\n\nPsychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility; this is somewhat less frequent but can often be helped.

These teeth begin to appear as early as three months , or as late as a year. It can take a few years for the entire first set of teeth to appear, though teething is often complete within one or two years. Occasionally an infant will be born with one or more teeth already protruding from the gums, but this is no cause for alarm.\nThough the order in which teeth appear during teething differs from person to person, it tends to follow a general pattern. The first teeth to appear are nearly always the central incisors, (those two teeth in the center of the mouth on the bottom). The top central and lateral incisors appear next, (the four central top teeth). Next come the bottom lateral incisors, (the two teeth on either side of the bottom central incisors). Then the basic molars (in the back of the jaw). And lastly, the eye teeth, (the pointed teeth on the top). Most infants have twenty baby teeth in all.\n\nThe symptoms of teething are now known to be extremely mild. However, because babies start to lose the immunity inherited from their mothers at around six months old, they coincidentally tend to pick up a lot of new infections around the time that teething commences. Here are some of the real symptoms of teething:\n\nSore and tender gums\nFlushed cheeks\nInflammation in the mouth.\nExcessive dribbling\nExcessive chewing\nA slight rise in temperature may occur immediately before a tooth erupts.

There are three major types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, andgestational diabetes.\n\nAll types of diabetes mellitus have something in common. Normally, your body breaks down the sugars and carbohydrates you eat into a special sugar called glucose. Glucose fuels the cells in your body. But the cells need insulin, a hormone, in your bloodstream in order to take in the glucose and use it for energy. With diabetes mellitus, either your body doesn’t make enough insulin, it can’t use the insulin it does produce, or a combination of both.\n\nSince the cells can’t take in the glucose, it builds up in your blood. High levels of blood glucose can damage the tiny blood vessels in yourkidneys, heart, eyes, or nervous system. That’s why diabetes — especially if left untreated — can eventually cause heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, and nerve damage to nerves in the feet. Type 1 diabetes is also called insulin-dependent diabetes. It used to be called juvenile-onset diabetes, because it often begins in childhood. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. It’s caused by the body attacking its own pancreas with antibodies. In people with type 1 diabetes, the damaged pancreas doesn’t make insulin. This type of diabetes may be caused by a genetic predisposition. It could also be the result of faulty beta cells in the pancreas that normally produce insulin.\nDR ARPIT CHOPRA (MD HOMOEOPATHY)\nChief Consultant Homoeopath & Biochemic\nAAROGYA SUPERSPECIALITY MODERN HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC(Computerised)\n102, First Floor, Krishna Tower, Opposite Curewell\nHospital, Newpalasia, Indore (M.P.)\nMob 9713092737 /  9713037737/ 9907527914(whats up no)\nPH - 0731-2532737, 3961737\nwebsite- www.homoeopathycure.com     For more info visit us at http://aarogyahomoeopathyindore.com/bizFloat/597b14463418d40accf24502/DIABETES-MELLITUS-CURE-BY-COMPLETE-PERMANENT-EASY-SAFE-FAST-COSTEFFECTIVE-PERMANENT-MODERN-HOMOEOPATHY-CURE-Diabetes-mellitus-or-diabetes-is-a-chronic-lifelong-condition-that-affects-your-body-s-abili', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/161.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', 'DIABETES MELLITUS CURE BY - PERMANENT, EASY, SAFE, FAST & COST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT', '', '', '', ''),

Generally, depression does not result from a single event, but from a combination of recent events and other longer-term or personal factors.\nDR ARPIT CHOPRA (MD HOMOEOPATHY)\nChief Consultant Homoeopath & Biochemic\nAAROGYA SUPERSPECIALITY MODERN HOMOEOPATHIC CLINIC(Computerised)\n102, First Floor, Krishna Tower, Opposite Curewell\nHospital, Newpalasia, Indore (M.P.)\nMob 9713092737 /  9713037737/ 9907527914(whats up no)\nPH - 0731-2532737, 3961737\nwebsite- www.homoeopathycure.com        For more info visit us at http://aarogyahomoeopathyindore.com/bizFloat/597b0b1108b0cf0ad809c2c6/DEPRESSION-CURE-BY-COMPLETE-PERMANENT-EASY-SAFE-FAST-COSTEFFECTIVE-PERMANENT-MODERN-HOMOEOPATHY-CURE-Depression-is-a-state-of-low-mood-and-aversion-to-activity-that-can-affect-a-person-s-thoughts-beha', 1, 'https://atzean.com/arogya-wp/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/164.webp', '', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', '2023-01-30 12:20:01', 'DEPRESSION CURE BY  - PERMANENT, EASY, SAFE, FAST & COST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT', '', '', '', ''),

There is no need to be embarrassed by your eczema. You are not alone. red_dry_skin_flame Atopic Dermatitis (which is often called eczema) is an itchy, red rash. It can appear all over the body. Many people have it on their elbows or behind their knees. Babies often have eczema on the face, especially the cheeks and chin. They can also have it on the scalp, trunk (chest and back), and outer arms and legs. Children and adults tend to have eczema on the neck, wrists, and ankles, and in areas that bend, like the inner elbow and knee. People with eczema are usually diagnosed with it when they are babies or young children. Eczema symptoms often become less severe as children grow into adults. For some people, eczema continues into adulthood. Less often, it can start in adulthood. The rash of eczema is different for each person. It may even look different or affect different parts of your body from time to time. It can be mild, moderate, or severe. Generally, people with eczema suffer from dry, sensitive skin. Eczema is also known for its intense itch. The itch may be so bad that you scratch your skin until it bleeds, which can make your rash even worse, leading to even more inflammation and itching.

You use all of them in hearing. Sound waves come in through your outer ear. They reach your middle ear, where they make your eardrum vibrate. The vibrations are transmitted through three tiny bones, called ossicles, in your middle ear. The vibrations travel to your inner ear, a snail-shaped organ. The inner ear makes the nerve impulses that are sent to the brain. Your brain recognizes them as sounds. The inner ear also controls balance.\nA middle ear infection (otitis media) is the most common cause of eardrum perforation. The eardrum can also be perforated by a sudden change in pressure—either an increase, such as that caused by an explosion, a slap, or diving underwater; or a decrease, such as occurs while flying in an airplane. Another cause is burns from heat or chemicals. The eardrum may also be perforated (punctured) by objects placed in the ear, such as a cotton-tipped swab, or by objects entering the ear accidentally, such as a low-hanging twig or a thrown pencil. An object that penetrates the eardrum can dislocate or fracture the chain of small bones (ossicles) that connect the eardrum to the inner ear. Pieces of the broken ossicles or the object itself may even penetrate the inner ear.

In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur, and have no immediate underlying cause while seizures that occur due to a specific cause are not deemed to represent epilepsy. The cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown, although some people develop epilepsy as the result of brain injury, stroke, brain tumors, and substance use disorders. Known genetic mutations are directly linked to only a small proportion of cases.[5][6] Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal cortical nerve cell activity in the brain.The diagnosis typically involves ruling out other conditions that might cause similar symptoms such as fainting.\n\nAdditionally, making the diagnosis involves determining if any other cause of seizures is present such as alcohol withdrawal or electrolyte problems. This may be done by imaging the brain and performing blood tests.[5] Epilepsy can often be confirmed with an electroencephalogram (EEG), but a normal test does not rule out the condition. Seizures are controllable with medication in about 70% of cases. In those whose seizures do not respond to medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered.

Emaciation is a predominant symptom of malnourishment, a basic component of poverty and famine that also occurs with diseases that interfere with the digestive system and appetite, other systems, and eating disorders. These include nutrient deficiency disorders, diseases with prolonged fever and infection, malignant diseases, parasitic infections that can result from contamination, anorexia nervosa and other conditions. The malnourishment associated with emaciation has been referred to as “inanition”, while infection by parasites has been described as “adulteration”.Treatment of emaciation includes gradual renourishment with a slow increase of daily caloric intake to help rebuild tissues and regain weight. Rest, and emotional and psychological therapy and support may be included.\n\nIn humans, the overall physical appearance of emaciation includes a thinning of the limbs, upper body and buttocks to an almost skeletal-seeming state with an apparent absence of fat and muscle tone. The skin is thin, dry and translucent in some areas of the body, to the point that veins beneath the skin are somewhat visible. The face is thin and drawn with a hopeless, vacant and distressed demeanor; the eye sockets are sunken, giving the eyes a bulging appearance. The scalp is bony with dry, withering hair that is lacking. On the torso, the collar bone, chest bone and ribs are quite pronounced; the stomach is bloated, which indicates gastrointestinal distress associated with nutritional depletion.

A penile erection is the hydraulic effect of blood entering and being retained in sponge-like bodies within the penis. The process is most often initiated as a result of sexual arousal, when signals are transmitted from the brain to nerves in the penis. The most important organic causes of impotence are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, neurological problems (for example, trauma from prostatectomy surgery), hormonal insufficiencies (hypogonadism) and drug side effects.\n\nPsychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility; this is somewhat less frequent but can often be helped. Notably, in psychological impotence, there is a strong response to placebo treatment.

There are two types: anterior (the most common), and posterior (less common, more likely to require medical attention). Sometimes in more severe cases, the blood can come up the nasolacrimal duct and out from the eye. Fresh blood and clotted blood can also flow down into the stomach and cause nausea and vomiting. Although the sight of large amounts of blood can be alarming and may warrant medical attention, nosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only 4 of the 2.4 million deaths in the U.S. in 1999. The causes of nosebleeds can generally be divided into two categories, local and systemic factors, although a significant number of nosebleeds occur with no obvious cause. Epistaxis, or bleeding from the nose, is a common complaint. It is rarely life threatening but may cause significant concern, especially among parents of small children. Most nosebleeds are benign, self-limiting, and spontaneous, but some can be recurrent. Many uncommon causes are also noted.

Eosinophils usually account for less than 7% of the circulating leukocytes.A marked increase in non-blood tissue eosinophil count noticed upon histopathologic examination is diagnostic for tissue eosinophilia.\n Several causes are known, with the most common being some form of allergic reaction or parasitic infection. Diagnosis of eosinophilia is via a complete blood count (CBC), but diagnostic procedures directed at the underlying cause vary depending on the suspected condition(s). An absolute eosinophil count is not generally needed if the CBC shows marked eosinophilia. The location of the causal factor can be used to classify eosinophilia into two general types: extrinsic, in which the factor lies outside of the eosinophil cell lineage; and intrinsic eosinophilia, which denotes etiologies within the eosiniphil cell line. Specific treatments are dictated by the causative condition, though in idiopathiceosinophilia, the disease may be controlled with corticosteroids.Eosinophilia is not a disorder (rather, only a sign) unless it is idiopathic.\n\nEosinophilia can be idiopathic (primary) or, more commonly, secondary to another disease. In the Western World, allergic or atopic diseases are the most common causes, especially those of the respiratory or integumentary systems.

It also addresses the transfer of&nbsp;<a title=\"Personal data\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data\">personal data</a>&nbsp;outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR\'s primary aim is to give individuals control over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for&nbsp;<a title=\"International business\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_business\">international business</a>&nbsp;by unifying the regulation within the EU.<sup id=\"cite_ref-1\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#cite_note-1\">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;Superseding the&nbsp;<a title=\"Data Protection Directive\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive\">Data Protection Directive</a>&nbsp;95/46/EC, the regulation contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of&nbsp;<a title=\"Personal data\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data\">personal data</a>&nbsp;of individuals (formally called&nbsp;<em>data subjects</em> in the GDPR) who are located in the EEA, and applies to any enterprise&mdash;regardless of its location and the data subjects\' citizenship or residence&mdash;that is processing the personal information of individuals inside the EEA.a</p>\r\n<p>Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place&nbsp;<em>appropriate technical and organizational measures</em>&nbsp;to implement the data protection principles. Business processes that handle personal data must be designed and built with consideration of the principles and provide safeguards to protect data (for example, using&nbsp;<a title=\"Pseudonymization\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonymization\">pseudonymization</a>&nbsp;or full&nbsp;<a title=\"Data anonymization\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_anonymization\">anonymization</a>&nbsp;where appropriate). Data controllers must design information systems with privacy in mind. For instance, using the highest-possible privacy settings by default, so that the datasets are not publicly available by default and cannot be used to identify a subject. No personal data may be processed unless this processing is done under one of the six lawful bases specified by the regulation (<a title=\"Consent\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent\">consent</a>, contract, public task, vital interest, legitimate interest or legal requirement). When the processing is based on consent the data subject has the right to revoke it at any time.</p>\r\n<p>Data controllers must clearly disclose any&nbsp;<a title=\"Data collection\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_collection\">data collection</a>, declare the lawful basis and purpose for data processing, and state how long data is being retained and if it is being shared with any third parties or outside of the EEA. Firms have the obligation to protect data of employees and consumers to the degree where only the necessary data is extracted with minimum interference with data privacy from employees, consumers, or third parties. Firms should have internal controls and regulations for various departments such as audit, internal controls, and operations. Data subjects have the right to request a&nbsp;<a title=\"Data portability\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_portability\">portable</a>&nbsp;copy of the data collected by a controller in a common format, and the right to have their&nbsp;<a title=\"Data erasure\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_erasure\">data erased</a>&nbsp;under certain circumstances. Public authorities, and businesses whose core activities consist of regular or systematic processing of personal data, are required to employ a&nbsp;<em>data protection officer</em>&nbsp;(DPO), who is responsible for managing compliance with the GDPR. Businesses must report&nbsp;<a title=\"Data breach\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach\">data breaches</a>&nbsp;to national supervisory authorities within 72 hours if they have an adverse effect on user privacy. In some cases, violators of the GDPR may be fined up to &euro;20 million or up to 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the preceding financial year in case of an enterprise, whichever is greater.</p>\r\n<p>The GDPR was adopted on 14 April 2016, and became enforceable beginning 25 May 2018. As the GDPR is a&nbsp;<a title=\"Regulation (European Union)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)\">regulation</a>, not a&nbsp;<a title=\"Directive (European Union)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)\">directive</a>, it is directly binding and applicable, but does provide flexibility for certain aspects of the regulation to be adjusted by individual member states.</p>\r\n<p>The regulation became a model for many national laws outside EU, including Chile, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and Kenya.

Although this act was not designed to be a privacy law, the act gave consumers the opportunity to examine their credit files and correct errors. It also placed restrictions on the use of information in credit records. Several congressional study groups in the late 1960s examined the growing ease with which automated personal information could be gathered and matched with other information.
